# Optional dependencies are not depended on directly, but may be used if present.

# em-http-request depends on http_parser.rb, which is supposed to be,
# but appears to not be, compatible with JRuby.
# http_parser.rb is highly unmaintained, with no responses on issues for 2 years.
# em-http-request is even less maintained, with no releases in 5 years.
