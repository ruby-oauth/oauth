# em-http-request depends on http_parser.rb, which is supposed to be,
# but appears to not be, compatible with JRuby.
# http_parser.rb is highly unmaintained, with no responses on issues for 2 years.
# em-http-request is even less maintained, with no releases in 5 years.

# This gem ships with Rails-specific integrations because it began life
#   as a Rails plugin, and they haven't been extracted yet.
# They are not required for, or by, the core library,
#   and must be required explicitly.
