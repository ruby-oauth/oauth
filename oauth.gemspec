You have installed oauth version #{gem_version}, congratulations!

Please see:
â€¢ #{spec.homepage}/-/blob/main/SECURITY.md
â€¢ #{spec.homepage}/-/blob/v#{spec.version}/CHANGELOG.md#111-2022-09-19

Major updates:
1. master branch renamed to main
â€¢ Update your local: git checkout master; git branch -m master main; git branch --unset-upstream; git branch -u origin/main
2. Github has been replaced with Gitlab; I wrote about some of the reasons here:
â€¢ https://dev.to/galtzo/im-leaving-github-50ba
â€¢ Update your local: git remote set-url origin git@gitlab.com:ruby-oauth/oauth.git
3. Google Group is active (again)!
â€¢ https://groups.google.com/g/oauth-ruby/c/QA_dtrXWXaE
4. Gitter Chat is active (still)!
â€¢ https://gitter.im/oauth-xx/
5. Non-commercial support for the 1.x series will end by April, 2025. Please make a plan to upgrade to the next version prior to that date.
Support will be dropped for Ruby 2.7 and any other Ruby versions which will also have reached EOL by then.
6. Gem releases are now cryptographically signed for security.

  #       This gem, and its gemspec development dependencies, will install on Ruby down to 2.3.x.
  #       This is because in CI easy installation of Ruby, via setup-ruby, is for >= 2.3.
